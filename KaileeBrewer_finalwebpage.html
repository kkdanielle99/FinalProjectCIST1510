<h1>Who Am I?</h1><!--summary of myself-->
<p>
    My name is Kailee Brewer and I am a 22 year old student at Southern Crescent Technical College majoring in graphic design. I am also a full time employee and entreprenuer of 
    Kailee's Monograms and More. I enjoy designing and making works of art with vinyl and in my down time, I enjoy watching Netflix and TikTok with my two dogs.
    Choosing Graphic design was not easy and I took several paths before this. I was a certified nursing assistant, a janitor, and a now a server.
    I decided this was my path because I am very fond of designing in my business and I would love to make this a career. I have a long way to go but 
    going back to school was the biggest and hardest step and the next step is finding a job in my field!
